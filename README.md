# ${1:YouTube Video Gate}

This is a Meteor application that allows you to put a video gate to collect contact info within a video on any YouTube video.

## Installation

In order to run this application you must have Node and Meteor installed.  Then run the application and go to http://localhost:3000/ like you would any Meteor application.  Enter in a YouTube URL and get going!

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions

TODO:  

You can view all the leads you collected by visiting this route: 

/widget/:_id/export

OR 

/export

This needs to be cleaned up.  Also ideally you would be able to connect leads directly to some service like Mailchimp or whatever you want.
